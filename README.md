# ELEC1204 Labs
This is my code for the advanced programming labs in the University of Southampton. They are written in C++ during my free time, as I did not take the module.

**P1**: A _sudoku_ solver using a _backtracking algorithm_ that outputs result in _console_.

**P2**: A basic digital _circuit simulator_ that accepts input from _console_ (incomplete).
